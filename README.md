# tic-tac-toe
A classic game reincarnated into a webpage. This project is a part of [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) curriculum.

I aimed to make the design feel fancy-yet-simple. Also decided to make the project a bit more unique by allowing the user to change the board size. *Well...* as it turns out, tic-tac-toe wasn't meant to be played on a non-3x3 board.

Have fun!

Also big shoutout to Alex Younger for making

article. It *really* helped me to get started with the new code architecture that was the purpose of this project.
